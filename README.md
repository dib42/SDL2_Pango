# SDL2_Pango

This is a port of SDL_Pango to SDL2, based on the [initial port] for
[Tux Paint] by Pere Pujal i Carabantes. It's been updated to newer
versions of autoconf, automake, and libtools, and the generated
files have been included in the repo so the package is ready to
be built.

## Installation

```bash
$ ./configure && make && make install
```


[initial port]: https://sourceforge.net/projects/tuxpaint-sdl2/files/SDL2_Pango/SDL2_Pango-0.1.2.tar.gz
[Tux Paint]: http://tuxpaint.org/
